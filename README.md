# prerequisites
java openjdk  #TODO how to install it? is there a jenv similarly to pyenv for easy install and version switch?

# console-app-start
Use IntelliJ from Jetbrains installed via Toolbox

Create console app folder-skeleton by 
    File - New project - Java - Select SDK              - just next - Command Line App - select app name & package path - then an intellij project will be generated
                                here I use openjdk 1.8
